**Title: Crew Lead  
Date: July 25, 2023  
Location: Tucson, Arizona**

Statistical Research, Inc. (SRI), a cultural resources consulting firm, has multiple positions available for crew leads for ongoing and upcoming fieldwork projects in Arizona and adjacent states. SRI provides comprehensive CRM services to private and government clients at the federal, state, and local levels throughout the western United States from offices in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Washington. Although the current positions will be based out of the Tucson office, successful candidates may be assigned to projects across SRI's entire footprint. Food allowance and lodging are provided for out-of-town assignments.

**Minimum Qualifications and Experience:**  
The ideal candidates should possess, at minimum, a Bachelor's degree in Archaeology, Anthropology, or a related field and have completed an accredited archaeological field school. Candidates must also have a minimum of 2 years of field experience working on and/or supervising monitoring, survey, testing, and data recovery projects and be physically fit and able to perform physically demanding tasks in adverse environmental conditions. Candidates should also have good organizational skills, a positive attitude, strong work ethic, and willingness to learn and execute new tasks. Prior experience in the Sonoran Desert and adjacent states will be viewed favorably but is not a requirement.

**Job Description:**  
The position of Crew Lead is responsible for assisting Project Directors in implementing survey, testing, monitoring, and data recovery plans and for coordinating through the appropriate channels all field and analytic tasks associated with fieldwork, analysis, and report preparation.  

For small-sized projects, the crew lead may also assume many of the tasks typically assigned to a project director, though he or she still works under the supervision of a project director. For larger projects, the crew lead works with a project director and/or principal investigator and the project manager to ensure that all tasks associated with project implementation are accomplished professionally and in a timely and fiscally responsible manner.

**Compensation:**  
The hourly rate for this project is between $24.00 and $31.00 per hour, depending on experience.  

Daily food allowance, when applicable based on the project, will be offered up to $59/day (no receipts required), and single-occupancy hotel accommodations will be provided.

**How to Apply**  
Applications should be submitted via e-mail to srijobs@sricrm.com with "Crew Lead - Tucson, Arizona" referenced in the subject line, and should include a resume of relevant experience and references (with contact information, including email addresses and telephone numbers). Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled and only applications submitted via srijobs@sricrm.com will be considered.
