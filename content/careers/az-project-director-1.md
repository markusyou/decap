**Title: Project Director  
Date: August 04, 2023  
Location: Tucson, Arizona**

Statistical Research, Inc. (SRI), a cultural resources management (CRM) consulting firm, has a long-term, full-time, position available for a Project Director (PD) based out of its Tucson, Arizona office. SRI provides comprehensive CRM services to private and government clients at the federal, state, and local levels throughout the western United States from offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Washington.

**Minimum qualifications and Experience:**  
The ideal candidate will have an MA or MS degree in anthropology with a focus in prehistoric archaeology, be Register of Professional Archaeologist certified, and possess a minimum of five years of field experience with at least two years demonstrable experience as a field supervisor on survey, testing, and/or data recovery projects. Prior experience working in the U.S. Southwest and Great Basin, a working command of federal and state cultural resource statutes and regulations, and demonstrable experience serving as lead author for Section 106 compliance reports will also be viewed favorably.

SRI offers a compensation package that includes an annual pay range between $58,000 and $75,000.00 and which will be commensurate with the applicant's credentials, experience, and industry standards. Employee benefits include professional development time and a comprehensive benefits package including medical, dental, life and disability insurance, retirement plan, and paid vacation/sick, and holiday leave.

**Job Description:**  
The position of PD is responsible for preparing and implementing survey, testing, monitoring, and data recovery plans, including all field and analytic tasks associated with fieldwork, analysis, and report preparation. This work routinely involves traveling and/or fieldwork. The PD is responsible for report writing and for having a solid understanding of the basics of CRM.

For small and medium-sized projects, the PD will report directly to a principal investigator (PI) or senior project director (SPD), though the PD is still ultimately responsible to the PI for that project. For larger projects, the PD will work with an SPD and/or the PI and the project manager to ensure that all project tasks are accomplished in a timely, fiscally responsible, and professional manner.

A PD will typically work on 2-3 projects simultaneously and is expected to be able to multitask. PDs are responsible for training crew members and crew chiefs in archaeological field methods and in-office descriptive writing tasks. The ability to work harmoniously and productively with other SRI staff and clients is essential. Finally, SRI PDs are expected to professionally perform their responsibilities and to remain professionally active in the CRM discipline.
