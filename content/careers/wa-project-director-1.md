**Title: Project Director  
Date: August 04, 2023  
Location: Washington State**

Statistical Research, Inc. (SRI), a cultural resources management (CRM) consulting firm, has one full-time position available for a Project Director (PD) based out of its Washington State office. SRI provides comprehensive CRM services to private and government clients at the federal, state, and local levels throughout the western United States from offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Washington, and there are times when these offices provide project-specific support to each other.

**Minimum qualifications and Experience:**  
The ideal candidate will have an M.A. or M.S. degree in anthropology with a focus in precontact or historical archaeology or architectural history, be Register of Professional Archaeologist certified, and possess a minimum of five years of field experience, with at least two years of experience as a field supervisor on survey, testing, and data recovery projects. The candidate must be permittable in Washington, with a working command of federal and state cultural resources statutes, regulations, and laws. Demonstrated prior experience serving as lead author for Section 106 compliance reports will be viewed favorably.

SRI offers a compensation package that includes an anticipated pay range between $54,000-$70,000, professional development, and a comprehensive benefits package that includes medical, dental, life and disability insurance; a retirement plan; and paid vacation/sick leave. The salary for this exempt position will be commensurate with the applicant's credentials, experience, and industry standards.

**Job Description:**  
The PD position is responsible for planning and implementing survey, testing, monitoring, and data recovery plans. The PD coordinates - through the appropriate channels - all tasks associated with fieldwork, analysis, and reporting. The responsibilities of the PD typically involve traveling and work in both the field and office. The PD is responsible for report writing and having a solid understanding of the basics of CRM.

For small- and medium-sized projects, the PD may assume additional tasks typically assigned to a principal investigator (PI) or senior project director (SPD), though the PD will still be ultimately responsible to the PI for any given project. For larger projects, the PD will work with an SPD and/or the PI and the project manager to ensure that all tasks associated with project implementation are accomplished professionally and in both a timely and fiscally responsible manner. For all projects in which the PD participates, the PD is responsible for meeting deadlines, staying within a given projects budget, and meeting SRI's standard of care.

The PD typically will work on multiple projects simultaneously and the PD is expected to multitask. A PD often is responsible for training field technician crew members and crew chiefs in archaeological field methods. The ability to work harmoniously and productively with other SRI staff and clients is essential. Also, the PD is expected to be a professionally active member of the discipline. Finally, the PD is expected at all times to behave with SRI staff members and clients in a manner that is appropriate.
