title = "CRM Founders Discuss Origins of Industry at the Society for American Archaeology Meeting"

+++
On Sunday, April 3, 2022, John Douglass (SRI) and Susan Chandler (Alpine Archaeological Consultants) organized and chaired a symposium at the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in Chicago focused on the origins of the CRM industry. The founders of nearly a dozen pioneering firms still in existence today, along with discussants (some representing the next generation of owners), discussed the origins of their firms and the industry itself, the trials and benefits of doing CRM today, the need for better engagement with those who are affected by our work, and the need for a sustainable future. Many of those participating in the session have held important leadership roles (including three Presidents) in the Society for American Archaeology and the American Cultural Resource Association.
