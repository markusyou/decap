SRI was recently at the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) conference in Portland! Our staff organized sessions, presented papers and posters, and worked the booth. In the photo you see two of our senior staff - Phil Leckman and Billy Graves - studying LIDAR data with their colleague, Kelly Jenks, a professor at New Mexico State University. We'll look forward to seeing you all next year in New Orleans at the SAA meeting!
