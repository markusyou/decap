The Playa Vista Archaeological and Historical Project is located near Marina del Rey in west Los Angeles. The project area, one of the largest residential and commercial developments in the nation, surrounds the Ballona Lagoon, formerly a rich estuarine environment fed by Ballona and Centinela Creeks. This area was a magnet for human settlement for thousands of years, drawing prehistoric, historical-period, and modern populations who left a rich and varied archaeological record. It would be difficult to find any single area more important to understanding the history of southern California. More than any other project, Playa Vista also showcases the skills of SRI personnel as researchers, managers, and anthropologists who can juggle project budgets and schedules, the concerns of Native Americans and other interested groups, and our client's needs while simultaneously maintaining a high quality of research, a commitment to historic preservation, and a thorough understanding of the applicable laws and regulations.

Estuary resources have been attractive to human populations for at least 8,000 years, and many ancient settlements were established along the shores and creeks of the lagoon. The Native Americans recognized as the Gabrielino/Tongva may have established the important village of Guaspet at the Ballona in the late prehistoric and early historical periods. For much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the project area was the focus of agricultural production, rural recreational activities, and, later, industrial activities related to oil production. The project area includes two groups of archaeological and historic properties: the Ballona Lagoon Archaeological District, which encompasses the many prehistoric archaeological sites, and the Hughes Industrial Historic District, which encompasses the buildings and facilities of the Culver City Plant.

SRI has been the CRM consultant for the Playa Vista project since 1989. This large, multi-phase development has required complicated and often sensitive cultural resource specialties, ranging from archaeological survey to assisting in the negotiation of legal and political issues.

In addition to providing traditional CRM services, SRI has worked closely with the client on various legal and political issues. Playa Vista is a highly visible and highly politicized project that will impact the lives of many residents of west Los Angeles. In our 30+ year involvement in the project, we have worked with diverse federal, state, and local agencies and Native American groups.

In addition, SRI has provided expertise on compliance with laws and regulations protecting cultural resources at the federal level (National Environmental Policy Act and National Historic Preservation Act); state level (California Environmental Quality Act, California Coastal Commission regulations, and California burial laws); and municipal level (City of Los Angeles Historical Commission ordinances).

Playa Vista has challenged our skills as anthropologists, managers, and archaeologists. SRI has risen successfully to meet these challenges, ensuring that this massive development stays on schedule and is compliant with all regulatory statutes regarding the protection of historic properties.
