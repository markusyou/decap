In 2015, SRI was subcontracted by MIRADOR to develop and test for U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) an approach to meeting DoD's National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, California. The project's main goal was to leverage existing data to predict the location of archaeological sites and buried cultural deposits on the Station in order to provide managers and stakeholders with objective tools for making cultural resource management (CRM) decisions. SRI developed a locational model and a buried-site potential model for NAWS China Lake by designing and populating a cultural resources database, developing a series of prehistoric and historical-period site types, acquiring and processing multiple environmental data, integrating new and existing geomorphic data, creating a diverse series of cultural and environmental predictor variables, and applying sophisticated statistical machine learning methods.
