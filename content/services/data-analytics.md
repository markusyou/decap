SRI's team is well-versed in analyzing large quantities of data to produce rich information. Our team is constantly collecting, enhancing, and analyzing data to better understand the projects we conduct on behalf of our customers. By leveraging our vast database of projects and prior experience, we build on the initial data gathering to produce high-quality reports that present our research findings for each project.

Services include:

* Data Analytics and Business Intelligence
* Data Science, including machine learning and predictive analytics
* Data Enhancement, leveraging geographic information systems (GIS) and related referential data

Sample customer projects have included:

* Developing data that support the economic modeling of water demand and use as it relates to rates and retail water-agency revenue stability with the goal of adapting and defining conservation-based water rates.
* Developing a GIS regional screening tool for assessing impacts on cultural resources throughout Southern California
* Developing a predictive model leveraging existing data to predict the location of archaeological sites and buried cultural deposits in order to provide managers and stakeholders with objective tools for making cultural resource management (CRM) decisions.
* Building a series of models predicting the location and significance of prehistoric archaeological sites. The project developed a locational model intended to provide the U.S. Navy with an objective assessment of where archaeological sites are likely to be located for areas that have not been—or cannot be—inventoried.
