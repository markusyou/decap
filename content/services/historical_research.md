SRI's Historic Program consists of individuals with expertise in the fields of history, historical archaeology, architectural history, archival research, and historic preservation. The program provides historical-period research support to other departments in the company and markets its services to clients who have a need for staff trained in the treatment of historical resources. With staff based in most of SRI's offices, the program has the ability to respond to the needs of clients quickly and efficiently.

The services of SRI's Historic Program include conducting records checks, routine and in-depth historical and archival research, and literature searches for all projects, as well as oral history interviews and ethnographic or ethnohistoric research. Other services include preparation of historic contexts, architectural surveys, assessing eligibility of historical-period resources for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), historical landscape analysis, and historic building condition assessments and rehabilitation plans. The staff is highly skilled in the preparation of NRHP nomination forms for historical-archaeological sites, historic buildings, structures, districts, and multiple-property nominations, as well as the preparation of Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS)/Historic American Engineering Record (HAER)/Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS) documentation. The program conducts archaeological survey, testing, and data recovery excavations on historical sites ranging from investigations of small, single-use occupations to township site surveys to the excavation of large, multiple-component historical-period sites.

Among projects conducted by the Historic Program are the excavation of the original cemetery in downtown Tucson, Arizona, which consisted of 1,083 graves as well as 100 years of post-cemetery residential and commercial use. Other projects have included: data recovery on the site of a 1916-1917 National Guard encampment in Nogales, Arizona, which was built along the border in response to Pancho Villa's incursion into the United States from Mexico; a survey of the archaeological features of the historical town of Rhyolite, Nevada; an architectural survey and NRHP evaluations of 26 buildings in the National Historic Landmark District at Fort Huachuca, Arizona; preparation of an NRHP nomination form for the Colossal Cave Mountain Park in Pima County, Arizona, incorporating 52 contributing historic resources; the identification and evaluation of Cold War-era property types for research, development, testing, and evaluation at various Department of Defense installations across the United States; and the development of a data recovery program for the Rincon/Prado town and ranch complex in Riverside County, California, that included intensive historical research and oral history interviews with individuals who participated in the local pottery industry. Among the publications produced by the staff of the Historic Program are _Life in the Past Lane: The Route 66 Experience_ (SRI Technical Series 86), a Southwest Books of the Year selection, and Volumes 1 and 2 of _The Desert Training Center/California-Arizona Maneuver Area_, _1942-1944: Historical and Archaeological Contexts_ (SRI Technical Series 75)_,_ a popular detailed historic context and overview of a unique facility.
